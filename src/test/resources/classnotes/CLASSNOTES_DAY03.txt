API Day 03

Yesterday : headers in request and response.

- provide additional information about request and response.
- when we do api testing, we pass headers in request and also verify headers of response as well
-> they are key+value format like a map in java
-> headers are used to specify content type, accept type
, also credentials, authorization information etc


REQUEST:
	Accept -> Application/json -> Hey API, I need Json response

	Accept -> Application/xml -> Hey API, I need XML response

RESPONSE:
	Content-type -> Application/json -> Hey client, i am sending JSON data to you. The response body in json format

	Content-type -> Application/xml => Hey client, i am sending XML data to you. The response body in XML format

	-> we can have many more headers in response. like Date, char-limit, etc


When I do API testing I send request to API endpoint along with headers. and Validate the API response status code , headers, json body

==============================

PARAMETERS in Rest API:

2 types of parameters we can pass to Rest API endpoint:
	1) path parameter -> also called URL parameter. The value is part of url:
		spartan_url/api/spartans/44
		https://library.com/api/books/2345

	The numbers at the end of above URLs are path parameters, and we can change to different values

	2) Query parameter
	It is not part of URL, it is passed as KEY+VALUE after URL.
	spartanBaseURL/api/spartans/search?nameContains=Tester

	spartanBaseURL/api/spartans/search?nameContains=Tester & gender=female

	? -> means that it is end of URL. everything after that is query parameters

ENDPOINT: https://www.etsy.com/search
QUERY PARAM: q=spoon
==========================================

Given Accept type is json
And path parameter id is 24
When I send request to /api/spartans/24
Then status code should be 200
And content type should be "application/json"
and json body should contain "Correy"

API documentation -> Swagger UI. Some documents in Jira, Confluence.

If no documentation or you want to see which API is called when you do actions in UI/Front end, we open Developer tools in chrome and goto network tab to see all backend calls/requests and responses.

Global Variable in Postman:
	We can save global variables with values in postman and can use those variable in any request in any collection.

	These variable are accessible for every request in Postman.

	To read value from variable, we use {{var_name}}

{{spartan_base_url}}/api/spartans/24
=======================================
BASE URL in RESTASSURED:

In RestAssured as well, there is a static variable RestAssured.baseUri = http://54.205.239.177:8000

If we set value to baseUri variable , then we do not have to type whole url in get method:

RestAssured.get("/api/spartans")

add new package:
	day03_api_parameters

SpartanWithApiParamsTest

@Test
public void getSpartanPathParamTest() {

}
=============================================


Given Accept type is json
And path parameter id is 1000
When I send request to /api/spartans/1000
Then status code should be 404
And content type should be "application/json"
and json body should contain "Not Found"
---------
{
  "timestamp": "2022-01-28T01:33:50.800+00:00",
  "status": 404,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "",
  "path": "/api/spartans/1000"
}


API Call -> sending API Request

Positive API Test: send request with valid parameters and headers to API Url. Verify status code 200 , headers and json body is as expected

Negative API Test: send request to API Enpoint/URL with invalid parameters/headers and verify status code is not 200 , it is 404, and json body contains error message

@Test
public void getSpartanPathParamNegativeTest() {

}

STATUS CODE: 404 - not found. it is a client error. happens when we request non existing data.

@Murodil , so we always have to do it manually first to see expected etc?

Furkan Cakin — Today at 8:58 PM
why do we have to do postman too if we are checking the documenattion

Yes, we always learn how API works in Swagger and test manually if it is passing manually as expected. then Automate it using RestAssured.

Similar QA process like UI.

=================================


{{spartan_base_url}}/api/spartans/search

Search API method in Spartan Rest API, accepts query parameters.

nameContains and gender

{{spartan_base_url}}/api/spartans/search?nameContains=J

{{spartan_base_url}}/api/spartans/search?nameContains=J&gender=Female

SELECT * FROM spartans
WHERE name LIKE '%J%'

https://www.etsy.com/search?q=iphone

Query params are passes as Key+Value after the URL.

{{spartan_base_url}}/api/spartans/search?nameContains=J

Given accept type is Json
        And query parameter values are:
        gender|Female
        nameContains|e
        When user sends GET request to /api/spartans/search
        Then response status code should be 200
        And response content-type: application/json
        And "Female" should be in response body
        And "Janette" should be in response body

54.205.239.177 -> its own database with values

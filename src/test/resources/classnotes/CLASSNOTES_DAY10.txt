Most of the APIs allow only get operations ? do i get it right? @Murodil

Each API application will have multiple endpoints, depending how developer designed it, some endpoints :
	- work with only GET
	- some work with POST method
	- some accepts parameters and some dont.

How do I know?
Need to check documentation or examples.
Documentation: Swagger UI, some documents with descriptions in Jira, Confluence etc
Or teammate can share API collection of Postman. where all endpoints with examples are present.


-------------------------------------------------------

When we send POST request to RESTful API, we include:
	-> json request body / json payload. It contains data that we want to be added to application database.
	-> headers. Accept - json, content-type json.


We saw example how we can include json with our request:
	1) as a String
	2) as a map / collection
	3) as a pojo class object

==================================================================

How do you know that Post request was successful?

1) status code: 201 - created
2) json response body, normally contains the data that was part of request json.
and success message
3) verify the data is matching in database
4) send GET request for that data that you posted and see if result is matching
5) search for the record in the UI and verify it is matching
.....


add new package day10_post_put_delete

add new class ORDSPostPutDeleteRegion

==================================================================

DELETE method is used to delete a record using API request.
We send DELETE request to Rest API method.
Normally we pass a path parameter with ID to be deleted.

when().delete("/api/spartans/206")
.then().assertThat().statusCode(200);

it may contain json response with message to indicate successful deletion.

==================================================================

DELETE REGION - by region_id
	POST REGION - by region_id and name. then verify response json matches post data.
	GET REGION - by region_id, then verify get response matches post data.

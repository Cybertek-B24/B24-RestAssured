@Murodil for the Interview Question how to you read from the excel sheet, can we now say I use Parameterized Test n my framework?

I use Apache POI library to read data from excel.
I have ExcelUtil class that helps me to read and write to excel sheet easily.
When I do data driven/parameterized tests and data is in excel file.
I use @ParameterizedTest annotation in Junit, then run test for each row in excel file.
